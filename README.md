Sudoku Game Implementation Report
1. Introduction
a. What is your application?
This application is a Python-based Sudoku game featuring:

Three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)

Custom board loading capability

Interactive GUI with pygame

Input validation and victory detection

Solution saving functionality

b. How to run the program?
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sudoku-game.git
Install dependencies:

bash
pip install pygame numpy
Run the game:

bash
python main.py
c. How to use the program?
Select difficulty from the menu

Click cells to select them

Press number keys (1-9) to fill cells

Use buttons:

Menu: Return to main menu

Exit: Quit the game

Check: Validate current inputs

Clear: Reset all user inputs

For custom boards:

Create custom_sudoku_board.txt with your puzzle

Select "Load Custom Board"

2. Body/Analysis
a. Functional Requirements Implementation
4 OOP Pillars:
1. Encapsulation
All classes encapsulate their internal state:

python
class Cell:
    def __init__(self, value: int, row: int, col: int):
        self._value = value  # Protected attribute
        self._row = row
        self._col = col
        
    @property
    def value(self) -> int:  # Controlled access
        return self._value
2. Abstraction
PuzzleGenerator hides complex Sudoku generation:

python
class PuzzleGenerator:
    def generate_puzzle(self, difficulty_config: dict):
        """Simple interface hiding implementation"""
        solution = self._generate_complete_solution()
        puzzle = self._remove_numbers(solution, difficulty_config)
        return puzzle, solution
3. Inheritance
DrawableCell extends base Cell functionality:

python
class DrawableCell(Cell):
    def __init__(self, value: int, row: int, col: int, solution: int):
        super().__init__(value, row, col)  # Inherit base functionality
        self._solution = solution  # Add new features
4. Polymorphism
UI elements share common interface:

python
def draw(self, screen: pygame.Surface):
    """Implemented differently by Menu, Grid, etc."""
    raise NotImplementedError
Design Pattern: Factory Method
Used in DifficultyMenu to create different game configurations:

python
def handle_event(self, event):
    if difficulty == 'Load Custom Board':
        return self._create_custom_config()  # Factory method
    return self.settings.DIFFICULTY_CONFIGS[difficulty]  # Predefined configs
Composition/Aggregation
SudokuGame composes multiple components:

python
class SudokuGame:
    def __init__(self):
        self.menu = DifficultyMenu()  # Composition
        self.grid = None  # Will aggregate Grid later
        self.game_controls = GameControls()  # Composition
File Operations
Custom board loading and solution saving:

python
# Loading
with open('custom_sudoku_board.txt', 'r') as f:
    puzzle = [[int(num) for num in line.split()] for line in f]

# Saving
with open('custom_sudoku_board_solved.txt', 'w') as f:
    for row in solution:
        f.write(' '.join(map(str, row)) + '\n'
Testing
Unit tests cover core functionality:

python
class TestGrid(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_victory_condition(self):
        grid = create_test_grid()
        grid.set_value(3)  # Correct value
        self.assertTrue(grid.victory)
